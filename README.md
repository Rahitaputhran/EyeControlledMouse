This project uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI to control the mouse cursor using eye movements. It detects facial landmarks, tracks eye position, and moves the cursor by tracking the right eye, while blinking the left eye triggers a mouse click. Requirements include OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI. Run the script to enable eye-tracking-based cursor control.
